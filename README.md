Note: This table provides a comprehensive list of features present in the FIFA dataset. Feel free to refer to specific columns based on your analysis needs.
# Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to prepare the FIFA dataset for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, refining data types, and enhancing overall usability. 
The dataset, initially containing 77 columns with diverse data types, required careful handling to ensure its quality and completeness.
# Conclusion
Data Quality Improvement
Removal of URLs and Duplicate Records: Ensured data integrity and consistency, creating a clean foundation for analysis.
One-Hot Encoding for Positions: Provided a structured representation of player positions, simplifying analysis.
Improved Organization with "Team & Contract" Separation: Enhanced data organization and usability.
Standardization of Measurements: Conversion of height, weight, and financial values for standardized and accurate measurements.
Datetime Data Transformation: Enabled in-depth time-related analysis through the transformation of date strings into datetime data types.
# Data Completeness
A comprehensive check for missing values was conducted, and necessary values were filled, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for further analysis.
# Enhanced Usability
Data transformation steps significantly improved the usability and interpretability of the dataset, making it more convenient for analysts and researchers.
In conclusion, data cleaning and transformation are foundational steps in any data analysis project. 
By addressing inconsistencies, refining data types, and enhancing data quality, we have set the stage for more meaningful and insightful analyses. 
The clean and structured dataset is now well-equipped for advanced analytics, visualizations, and modeling.
This project not only improves the quality of our data but also provides a strong foundation for subsequent tasks, including exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and reporting. We look forward to leveraging this clean dataset to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions in the world of FIFA data analysis.
